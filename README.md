FITS File
FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) is a standard format commonly used in astronomy to store and transmit scientific data. It supports multi-dimensional arrays, which are commonly used to represent images, as well as tables and other types of data. FITS files are widely used for storing astronomical images, spectra, and other data.

SkyView Form
SkyView is a virtual observatory providing access to a wide range of astronomical images from various ground- and space-based observatories. The SkyView Form is an interface that allows users to specify parameters such as coordinates, image size, and desired survey or wavelength band to generate custom astronomical images.

Andromeda Galaxy â€” SDSS g-band and DSS2 Blue
This likely refers to images of the Andromeda Galaxy taken in different wavelength bands or by different surveys. SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey) and DSS2 (Digitized Sky Survey 2) are two survey projects that have captured images of the sky in various wavelength bands. "g-band" refers to a specific wavelength band used in the SDSS survey, while "Blue" likely refers to a similar band used in the DSS2 survey.

Pixel Scaling
Pixel scaling refers to the conversion factor between the physical size of an object in the sky and the corresponding size of the pixels in the image. It determines how much sky area each pixel in the image represents.

Pixel Distribution
Pixel distribution refers to the arrangement and intensity of pixels within an image. It describes how pixel values are distributed across the image and can be analyzed to extract information about the contents of the image, such as the presence of objects, structures, or patterns.

ZScale Interval
ZScale interval is a method used for scaling the intensity values of pixels in an image to enhance visibility and contrast. It involves determining the range of pixel values within the image and mapping them to a predefined intensity scale, typically ranging from black to white.
